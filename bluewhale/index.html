                    What is the biggest animal in the world? If your answer is the Blue Whale, you're right. One day,
                    I was surfing the web, and I accidentally found an article about blue whales on nationalgeographic.com.
                    It was an interesting article, so I started searching the web for "Blue Whale". I found a lot of
                    interesting stuff there, like the ICUN red list level of the blue whale is "critically endangered".
                    Today, I am going tell you about Blue Whales.

                    The blue whale is a subspecies of whales and they, just like other whales, are threatened by environmental
                    changes such as habitat loss and toxics. They are also harmed by ship strikes, becoming entangled in fiching
                    gear and the rising sea levels. Whales are at the top of the food chain and plays an important role in
                    the overall health of the marine environment. But the main reason is because of human activity. And that's
                    why we should protect the Blue Whale.

                    All Whales are Mammals. Blue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on Earth.
                    These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans a up to 100 feet long and upwards of 200 tons. Their
                    tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts? as much as an automobile.

                    Their Diet includes krill, which is a tiny shrimplike animal. During a year, a single adult blue whale
                    consumes around 4 tons of krill each day. First, The 200-ton thing eat by first swallowing a giant
                    mouthful of water. Then, it will process the water by running the water through the gills of the blue
                    whale, which will keep the krill in, but push the rest of the water into the ocean. Then, they will
                    force the krill down into their tummies.
