                <p>HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, is a standardized system for tagging text/html files to achieve <wbr />
                font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.</p>

                <p>
                    HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, <wbr />
                    published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 <wbr />
                    and was a major version of HTML. HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with 
                    <wbr />various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and <wbr />
                    specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much 
                    <wbr />easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient. (This site was created with HTML5.)
