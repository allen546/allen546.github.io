                    HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, is a standardized system for tagging text/html files to achieve <wbr />
                    font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. <wbr />
                    HTML is used to create webpages that are displayed on the Internet. Each page contains a <wbr />
                    series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see on the Internet <wbr />
                    is written using one version of HTML code or another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, <wbr />
                    a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also <wbr />
                    provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its <wbr />
                    appearance. One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).

                    HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, <wbr />
                    published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version <wbr />
                    of HTML. HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. <wbr />
                    Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed <wbr />
                    its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient. <wbr />
                    (This site was created with HTML5.)

                    To build a website, you need an HTML editor. Any text editor will work, but I suggest using 
                    <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, <wbr />
                    <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> or 
                    <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs">Visual Studio</a>. 
                    Be sure to save it as an .htm or .html file!
